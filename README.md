# Description

Grey's Memorial Hospital's pharmacy system is a web application that enables both patients and staff members to interact with each other.

Some features of the application are: 
- When users visit the site they are prompted to either log in or register.
    - Doctor accounts are generated on the back-end and cannot be created, these accounts are validated through the email domain. 
    - When a user creates a profile they are randomly assigned a doctor from the available doctors in the system. 
- When a patient logs in they are able to view their current medications and select a combination to view the total cost. 
- When a staff member logs in they are able to see the patients they have been assigned and assign medications to them.
